# Financial News Sentiment Analysis Platform Documentation

## Project Overview
The Financial News Sentiment Analysis Platform is a full-stack web application that provides real-time sentiment analysis of financial news and stock market data. The platform helps investors and financial analysts make data-driven decisions by aggregating news from various sources and analyzing the sentiment impact on specific stocks.

## Architecture

### Backend (FastAPI)
The backend is built using FastAPI, a modern, fast web framework for building APIs with Python. The architecture follows a modular design pattern with the following components:

1. **API Routes**
   - News endpoints for fetching and processing financial news
   - Stock information endpoints for real-time market data
   - Analysis endpoints for sentiment analysis
   - Watchlist management for tracking specific stocks
   - User management for authentication and personalization

2. **Core Features**
   - Real-time news aggregation
   - Sentiment analysis using NLP
   - Stock market data integration
   - User watchlist management
   - RESTful API design

### Frontend (React + TypeScript)
The frontend is built using React with TypeScript, providing a robust and type-safe user interface. Key features include:

1. **User Interface**
   - Modern, responsive design
   - Real-time data updates
   - Interactive charts and visualizations
   - User authentication and personalization

2. **Technical Stack**
   - React for UI components
   - TypeScript for type safety
   - Modern state management
   - RESTful API integration
