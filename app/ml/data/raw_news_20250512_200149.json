Let\u2019s analyze the charts of the top 10 cryptocurrencies to find out.S&P 500 Index price predictionThe S&P 500 Index gapped up sharply on May 12 and rose above the stiff overhead resistance at 5,800.SPX daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph\/TradingViewTime is running out for the bears. If they want to prevent the upside, they will have to fiercely defend the 5,800 level and quickly drag the price below the 20-day exponential moving average (5,570). If they manage to do that, the index could start a deeper correction toward 5,400.Instead, if the price closes above 5,800, the up move may continue toward the 6,000 level. There could be a minor halt at 6,000, but if the bulls prevail, the index could retest the all-time high at 6,147.US Dollar Index price predictionThe US Dollar Index pierced the 20-day EMA (100.42) on May 8, indicating that the bears are losing their grip.DXY daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph\/TradingViewSellers tried to pull the price back below the 20-day EMA on May 9, but the bulls held their ground. The index has reached the 50-day simple moving average (102.08), which is expected to behave as a resistance.\u00a0If the price turns down from the 50-day SMA but finds support at the 20-day EMA, it suggests a positive sentiment. That increases the likelihood of a rally to 103.54 and thereafter to 104.68.Bitcoin price predictionBitcoin has turned down from $105,819, indicating that the bears are defending the $107,000 to $109,588 zone.BTC\/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph\/TradingViewThe first support on the downside is the $100,000 level, and below that, the 20-day EMA ($97,238). If the price rebounds off the support zone, the bulls will again try to kick the BTC\/USDT pair above $109,588. If they can pull it off, the pair could ascend to $130,000.Conversely, if the price turns down and breaks below the 20-day EMA, it signals that buyers are booking profits at higher levels. That opens the doors for a fall to $93,000 and then to the 50-day SMA ($89,302).Ether price predictionEther (ETH) bulls are trying to sustain the price above $2,550, but the bears have kept up the selling pressure.ETH\/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph\/TradingViewIf the price skids below $2,435, the ETH\/USDT pair may fall to $2,320. If the price rebounds off $2,320, the bulls will try to resume the up move. There is resistance at $2,850, but if it is crossed, the pair could reach $3,000.Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns down and breaks below $2,320, it suggests that the bulls are booking profits. The pair may drop to the breakout level of $2,111, which is likely to act as support.XRP price predictionXRP (XRP) broke above the resistance line on May 10, and the bulls successfully held the retest of the breakout level on May 11.XRP\/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph\/TradingViewThe bulls have strengthened their position by pushing the price above the $2.50 resistance. There is minor resistance at $2.65, but if the level is scaled, the rally could reach $3. Such a move signals a potential trend change.Alternatively, if the price turns down sharply from $2.65 and breaks below the 20-day EMA ($2.27), it signals a possible range formation in the near term. The XRP\/USDT pair could swing between $2 and $2.65 for some time.BNB price predictionBNB (BNB) turned down from $679 on May 10 but rebounded off the breakout level of $644 on May 12.BNB\/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph\/TradingViewBuyers tried to resume the up move, but the long wick on the candlestick shows selling near the $700 level. If the price stays above $644, the bulls will make another attempt to propel the BNB\/USDT pair to $745.Sellers will have to pull the price below $644 to weaken the bulls. The pair could then fall to the 20-day EMA ($621). Buyers are expected to defend the 20-day EMA because a break below it could tilt the advantage in favor of the bears.Solana price predictionSolana\u2019s (SOL) up move has stalled near the $180 resistance, but a positive sign is that the bulls have not given up much ground to the bears.\u00a0SOL\/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph\/TradingViewA shallow pullback increases the possibility of the continuation of the rally. If buyers drive the price above $180, the SOL\/USDT pair could rally to $210.The immediate support on the downside is at $168. If the price slides below $168, the pair could descend to the 20-day EMA ($155). A solid rebound off the 20-day EMA suggests the bulls remain in control. That increases the likelihood of a break above $180. Sellers will gain the upper hand on a break below $153.Related: Bitcoin set for $150K BTC price rally as US, China agree to slash tariffsDogecoin price predictionDogecoin (DOGE) turned down from $0.26 on May 11, indicating profit booking by short-term buyers.DOGE\/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph\/TradingViewThe bulls are expected to aggressively defend the breakout level of $0.21. If the price rebounds off $0.21 with strength, it signals that the bulls have flipped the level into support. The DOGE\/USDT pair could then climb to $0.31.On the contrary, a break and close below the $0.21 level suggests that bears remain active at higher levels. The pair could then drop to the moving averages, pointing to a possible range formation between $0.14 and $0.26 in the near term.Cardano price predictionCardano (ADA) is facing resistance near $0.86, but a positive sign is that the bulls have not ceded much ground to the bears.ADA\/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph\/TradingViewThe 20-day EMA ($0.72) has started to turn up, and the RSI is near the overbought area, indicating an advantage to buyers. If the price rebounds off the neckline, the bulls will try to propel the ADA\/USDT pair above $0.856. If they can pull it off, the pair could travel to the target objective of $1.01.If sellers want to prevent the upside, they will have to swiftly yank the price below the moving averages. If they do that, the pair could descend to the solid support at $0.58.Sui price predictionSui (SUI) is facing selling at $4.25, but a positive sign is that the bulls have maintained the price above the breakout level of $3.90.SUI\/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph\/TradingViewBoth moving averages are sloping up, and the RSI is near the overbought zone, indicating that the path of least resistance is to the upside. If buyers clear the $4.25 level, the SUI\/USDT pair could soar to $5.The first sign of weakness will be a break and close below the $3.90 level. That opens the doors for a fall to the 20-day EMA ($3.48). A bounce off the 20-day EMA signals that the positive momentum remains intact. The bulls will then again try to clear the overhead hurdle at $4.25.\u00a0This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

That opens the doors for a fall to $93,000 and then to the 50-day SMA ($89,302).Ether price predictionEther (ETH) bulls are trying to sustain the price above $2,550, but the bears have kept up the selling pressure.ETH\/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph\/TradingViewIf the price skids below $2,435, the ETH\/USDT pair may fall to $2,320. If the price rebounds off $2,320, the bulls will try to resume the up move. There is resistance at $2,850, but if it is crossed, the pair could reach $3,000.Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns down and breaks below $2,320, it suggests that the bulls are booking profits. The pair may drop to the breakout level of $2,111, which is likely to act as support.XRP price predictionXRP (XRP) broke above the resistance line on May 10, and the bulls successfully held the retest of the breakout level on May 11.XRP\/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph\/TradingViewThe bulls have strengthened their position by pushing the price above the $2.50 resistance. There is minor resistance at $2.65, but if the level is scaled, the rally could reach $3. Such a move signals a potential trend change.Alternatively, if the price turns down sharply from $2.65 and breaks below the 20-day EMA ($2.27), it signals a possible range formation in the near term. The XRP\/USDT pair could swing between $2 and $2.65 for some time.BNB price predictionBNB (BNB) turned down from $679 on May 10 but rebounded off the breakout level of $644 on May 12.BNB\/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph\/TradingViewBuyers tried to resume the up move, but the long wick on the candlestick shows selling near the $700 level. If the price stays above $644, the bulls will make another attempt to propel the BNB\/USDT pair to $745.Sellers will have to pull the price below $644 to weaken the bulls. The pair could then fall to the 20-day EMA ($621). Buyers are expected to defend the 20-day EMA because a break below it could tilt the advantage in favor of the bears.Solana price predictionSolana\u2019s (SOL) up move has stalled near the $180 resistance, but a positive sign is that the bulls have not given up much ground to the bears.\u00a0SOL\/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph\/TradingViewA shallow pullback increases the possibility of the continuation of the rally. If buyers drive the price above $180, the SOL\/USDT pair could rally to $210.The immediate support on the downside is at $168. If the price slides below $168, the pair could descend to the 20-day EMA ($155). A solid rebound off the 20-day EMA suggests the bulls remain in control. That increases the likelihood of a break above $180. Sellers will gain the upper hand on a break below $153.Related: Bitcoin set for $150K BTC price rally as US, China agree to slash tariffsDogecoin price predictionDogecoin (DOGE) turned down from $0.26 on May 11, indicating profit booking by short-term buyers.DOGE\/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph\/TradingViewThe bulls are expected to aggressively defend the breakout level of $0.21. If the price rebounds off $0.21 with strength, it signals that the bulls have flipped the level into support. The DOGE\/USDT pair could then climb to $0.31.On the contrary, a break and close below the $0.21 level suggests that bears remain active at higher levels. The pair could then drop to the moving averages, pointing to a possible range formation between $0.14 and $0.26 in the near term.Cardano price predictionCardano (ADA) is facing resistance near $0.86, but a positive sign is that the bulls have not ceded much ground to the bears.ADA\/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph\/TradingViewThe 20-day EMA ($0.72) has started to turn up, and the RSI is near the overbought area, indicating an advantage to buyers. If the price rebounds off the neckline, the bulls will try to propel the ADA\/USDT pair above $0.856. If they can pull it off, the pair could travel to the target objective of $1.01.If sellers want to prevent the upside, they will have to swiftly yank the price below the moving averages. If they do that, the pair could descend to the solid support at $0.58.Sui price predictionSui (SUI) is facing selling at $4.25, but a positive sign is that the bulls have maintained the price above the breakout level of $3.90.SUI\/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph\/TradingViewBoth moving averages are sloping up, and the RSI is near the overbought zone, indicating that the path of least resistance is to the upside. If buyers clear the $4.25 level, the SUI\/USDT pair could soar to $5.The first sign of weakness will be a break and close below the $3.90 level. That opens the doors for a fall to the 20-day EMA ($3.48). A bounce off the 20-day EMA signals that the positive momentum remains intact. The bulls will then again try to clear the overhead hurdle at $4.25.\u00a0This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

    "title":"What is RISC-V, and why does Vitalik Buterin want it for Ethereum smart contracts?",
    "description":"What is RISC-V?              RISC-V, pronounced \u201crisk five,\u201d is a modern open-source instruction set architecture (ISA) based on reduced instruction set computer (RISC) principles. In simple terms, it\u2019s like a blueprint that defines a set of instructions that a processor can execute.RISC-V is designed to be highly modular, efficient and flexible. Originally developed by the University of California in 2010, the open-source framework gives developers the flexibility to tailor its functionality and use cases, plus offers cost savings compared to proprietary ISAs like ARM or x86. This offers a wide range of uses, from supercomputers to smartphones and now blockchains like Ethereum.On April 20, 2025, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin unveiled a \u201cradical\u201d new scaling proposal to replace the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) with the RISC-V instruction set architecture, aiming to boost the speed and efficiency of the network\u2019s execution layer. The idea is that RISC-V is the best way to solve the blockchain\u2019s scalability constraints.\u00a0\u201cIt aims to greatly improve the efficiency of the Ethereum execution layer, resolving one of the primary scaling bottlenecks, and can also greatly improve the execution layer\u2019s simplicity - in fact, it is perhaps the only way to do so.The idea: replace the EVM with RISC-V as the virtual machine language that smart contracts are written in,\u201d said Buterin.Ethereum continues to face high transaction fees and reduced transaction volume as users shift to layer 2s for cheaper, faster transactions. This aligns with Ethereum\u2019s scaling strategy post-Merge (2022). Buterin\u2019s idea to reshape the chain is seen as a chance for it to modernize and retain its dominance as a top smart contracting platform.Did you know? Ethereum\u2019s execution layer has become its main scalability bottleneck. The inefficient processing of smart contracts and transactions due to single-threaded execution, wasteful computational design and complex state management is causing network congestion.                  How would RISC-V work on Ethereum?              Adding RISC-V to Ethereum is still just a proposal being discussed by the community and network governance. Buterin outlines several approaches to implement the proposal, including running two virtual machines (VMs) or a complete switch to RISC-V.The first idea to support VMs would enable contracts to be written and executed in either the existing EVM model or RISC-V. Both contract types would have access to functionality such as persistent storage, holding Ether (ETH) balances and making and receiving calls. Adding to this, the contract could integrate so they can call one another.\u00a0An alternative approach, described as \u201cmore radical,\u201d would modify the protocol to convert existing EVM contracts. This would require rewriting current contracts to interact with an EVM interpreter, while new contracts would be written directly in RISC-V.A major challenge for such a drastic change is to avoid breaking existing decentralized applications (DApps) and smart contracts. Ethereum can\u2019t risk breaking existing contracts written in the current EVM code. A transitional solution could involve using an interpreter \u2014 essentially a translation layer between different computing languages. This would allow developers to begin building with RISC-V while ensuring legacy EVM contracts continue to function without disruption.Did you know? In 2022, Ethereum made a leap forward in its energy efficiency and delivered more scalability, security and sustainability. In a process dubbed \u201cThe Merge,\u201d the chain switched from a proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism to proof-of-stake (PoS). This involved merging the Ethereum mainnet with a separate PoS blockchain called Beacon Chain.                  Key benefits of RISC-V vs. EVM              If RISC-V causes a major shift in the Ethereum architecture, what will be the benefits of making this change? In the long run, RISC-V would enhance the Ethereum smart contracts\u2019 performance and processing.According to Buterin, the new architecture could theoretically deliver efficiency gains of 100x; in reality, this number will be hard to reach, but gains would still be significant. The efficiency gains are tied to RISC-V\u2019s suitability for both zero-knowledge (ZK) proof systems and general smart contract execution, as it eliminates EVM overhead.It\u2019s less about replacing the EVM outright and more about using RISC-V as a backend for zkEVM or similar ZK rollups, where proving costs dominate. Scalability improvements would largely come from offloading execution to ZK rollups, with RISC-V optimizing the proving process.RISC-V smart contracts could run faster and use fewer computational resources. This increased efficiency would likely translate to lower gas fees for the end users. In the process, it would also enable the network to handle more users and transactions without slowing down. That would be a direct improvement to the scalability of Ethereum, potentially solving one of the biggest criticized points of the blockchain industry.\u00a0Additionally, RISC-V\u2019s simple, flexible instruction set is better suited for ZK-proof computations than the EVM, which incurs overhead from administrative tasks like gas accounting and state management.\u00a0Rather than rebuilding the EVM for ZK-proofs, RISC-V offers a streamlined alternative, simplifying the development of ZK-optimized execution layers. This could accelerate Ethereum\u2019s roadmap for privacy and scalability via ZK rollups, making RISC-V a compelling complement to the EVM.Below is a comparison table summarizing the key differences and benefits of RISC-V vs. the EVM.Did you know? Ethereum has gone through several major development milestones over its first decade. Notably, in 2016, it conducted a hard fork to roll back the chain after The DAO hack. The result is still noticeable today with Ethereum and Ethereum Classic chains both in existence.                  Will RISC-V be implemented in the future?              Buterin\u2019s proposal has sparked a lively debate among Ethereum users and developers. It is an ambitious idea that could be a milestone in the development roadmap for the leading smart contract blockchain.\u00a0Programmer Ben Adams raised several concerns about the proposal: In short, the ZK-proof might become more efficient, but there could be a trade-off. Block building and execution, which run the smart contracts, could end up becoming significantly slower.\u00a0\u201cThe risk here is that ZK-proving may get better, but block building and execution will deteriorate significantly,\u201d commented Ben Adams.A sentiment that was echoed by another anonymous commenter, \u201cI agree with Ben Adams here, The EVM as a whole is very much U256 based, so abstracting down to RISC-V would decrease overall execution performance.\u201dOthers appeared to agree that RISC-V was a good idea to help reduce bottlenecks but questioned if it was a priority, given the potential technical difficulty and cost.\u00a0\u201cAgree, it seems like a good idea for the L1 that solves points 2 and 3 of the L1 bottlenecks. But is this the set of priorities we want to solve for, especially given the scale of technical cost here?\u201d added Adam Cochran.\u00a0It\u2019s clear that the proposal still needs clarity and further discussions within the Ethereum community. While the promise is one of radical simplification that drives efficiency and speed, it also introduces a complex technical change. It would require potentially years of dedication to rethinking how the layer-1 blockchain works.Of course, as with any decentralized project, the green light doesn\u2019t just rely on technical planning; it needs the consent of the community. So, currently, Buterin\u2019s proposal has opened a wide conversation about any impending development action.",

The inefficient processing of smart contracts and transactions due to single-threaded execution, wasteful computational design and complex state management is causing network congestion.                  How would RISC-V work on Ethereum?              Adding RISC-V to Ethereum is still just a proposal being discussed by the community and network governance. Buterin outlines several approaches to implement the proposal, including running two virtual machines (VMs) or a complete switch to RISC-V.The first idea to support VMs would enable contracts to be written and executed in either the existing EVM model or RISC-V. Both contract types would have access to functionality such as persistent storage, holding Ether (ETH) balances and making and receiving calls. Adding to this, the contract could integrate so they can call one another.\u00a0An alternative approach, described as \u201cmore radical,\u201d would modify the protocol to convert existing EVM contracts. This would require rewriting current contracts to interact with an EVM interpreter, while new contracts would be written directly in RISC-V.A major challenge for such a drastic change is to avoid breaking existing decentralized applications (DApps) and smart contracts. Ethereum can\u2019t risk breaking existing contracts written in the current EVM code. A transitional solution could involve using an interpreter \u2014 essentially a translation layer between different computing languages. This would allow developers to begin building with RISC-V while ensuring legacy EVM contracts continue to function without disruption.Did you know? In 2022, Ethereum made a leap forward in its energy efficiency and delivered more scalability, security and sustainability. In a process dubbed \u201cThe Merge,\u201d the chain switched from a proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism to proof-of-stake (PoS). This involved merging the Ethereum mainnet with a separate PoS blockchain called Beacon Chain.                  Key benefits of RISC-V vs. EVM              If RISC-V causes a major shift in the Ethereum architecture, what will be the benefits of making this change? In the long run, RISC-V would enhance the Ethereum smart contracts\u2019 performance and processing.According to Buterin, the new architecture could theoretically deliver efficiency gains of 100x; in reality, this number will be hard to reach, but gains would still be significant. The efficiency gains are tied to RISC-V\u2019s suitability for both zero-knowledge (ZK) proof systems and general smart contract execution, as it eliminates EVM overhead.It\u2019s less about replacing the EVM outright and more about using RISC-V as a backend for zkEVM or similar ZK rollups, where proving costs dominate. Scalability improvements would largely come from offloading execution to ZK rollups, with RISC-V optimizing the proving process.RISC-V smart contracts could run faster and use fewer computational resources. This increased efficiency would likely translate to lower gas fees for the end users. In the process, it would also enable the network to handle more users and transactions without slowing down. That would be a direct improvement to the scalability of Ethereum, potentially solving one of the biggest criticized points of the blockchain industry.\u00a0Additionally, RISC-V\u2019s simple, flexible instruction set is better suited for ZK-proof computations than the EVM, which incurs overhead from administrative tasks like gas accounting and state management.\u00a0Rather than rebuilding the EVM for ZK-proofs, RISC-V offers a streamlined alternative, simplifying the development of ZK-optimized execution layers. This could accelerate Ethereum\u2019s roadmap for privacy and scalability via ZK rollups, making RISC-V a compelling complement to the EVM.Below is a comparison table summarizing the key differences and benefits of RISC-V vs. the EVM.Did you know? Ethereum has gone through several major development milestones over its first decade. Notably, in 2016, it conducted a hard fork to roll back the chain after The DAO hack. The result is still noticeable today with Ethereum and Ethereum Classic chains both in existence.                  Will RISC-V be implemented in the future?              Buterin\u2019s proposal has sparked a lively debate among Ethereum users and developers. It is an ambitious idea that could be a milestone in the development roadmap for the leading smart contract blockchain.\u00a0Programmer Ben Adams raised several concerns about the proposal: In short, the ZK-proof might become more efficient, but there could be a trade-off. Block building and execution, which run the smart contracts, could end up becoming significantly slower.\u00a0\u201cThe risk here is that ZK-proving may get better, but block building and execution will deteriorate significantly,\u201d commented Ben Adams.A sentiment that was echoed by another anonymous commenter, \u201cI agree with Ben Adams here, The EVM as a whole is very much U256 based, so abstracting down to RISC-V would decrease overall execution performance.\u201dOthers appeared to agree that RISC-V was a good idea to help reduce bottlenecks but questioned if it was a priority, given the potential technical difficulty and cost.\u00a0\u201cAgree, it seems like a good idea for the L1 that solves points 2 and 3 of the L1 bottlenecks. But is this the set of priorities we want to solve for, especially given the scale of technical cost here?\u201d added Adam Cochran.\u00a0It\u2019s clear that the proposal still needs clarity and further discussions within the Ethereum community. While the promise is one of radical simplification that drives efficiency and speed, it also introduces a complex technical change. It would require potentially years of dedication to rethinking how the layer-1 blockchain works.Of course, as with any decentralized project, the green light doesn\u2019t just rely on technical planning; it needs the consent of the community. So, currently, Buterin\u2019s proposal has opened a wide conversation about any impending development action.",

    "description":"Social engineering in crypto, explained              In the world of cryptocurrency, security goes beyond just protecting your wallet with a password or private key. One of the most deceptive and increasingly dangerous threats to crypto users today is social engineering.While you might think of cyberattacks as highly technical affairs, social engineering manipulates the most vulnerable aspect of security: human nature.\u00a0At its core, social engineering refers to the act of manipulating people into divulging confidential information or granting unauthorized access to systems.\u00a0Unlike traditional hacking, which typically exploits technological vulnerabilities, social engineering targets the human element. Attackers rely on deception, psychological manipulation and trust-building tactics to deceive their victims. By exploiting psychological weaknesses, attackers can trick individuals into giving up their private information, credentials or funds.\u00a0In the world of crypto, this kind of manipulation is especially dangerous because transactions are irreversible, and the decentralized nature of cryptocurrencies can make it even harder to recover lost funds. Once funds are transferred or access is granted, it\u2019s almost impossible to reverse the action. This makes crypto users a prime target for social engineering attacks.Did you know? In 2024, phishing and spoofing topped the US Federal Bureau of Investigation\u2019s list of reported cybercrimes, with victims also losing over $6.5 billion to crypto-related investment fraud, according to the Internet Crime Complaint Center.                  Anatomy of a social engineering attack: Step by step              Social engineering attacks trick crypto users by gaining trust, creating urgency, and then stealing sensitive info to drain their wallets.Step 1: The setup \u2014 Scouting for targetsScammers start by lurking on social media platforms such as X, Discord, Telegram and Reddit.They look for:Newbies asking for helpPeople showing off their gains or NFTsUsers who accidentally leak wallet addresses or emails.The more info they gather, the easier it is to craft a personalized attack.Step 2: The approach \u2014 Gaining trustNext, they reach out, pretending to be:A helpful support agent (e.g., from MetaMask, Binance)A famous crypto influencerA friend or community manager.They copy profile pictures, usernames (sometimes with slight changes), and even fake verification badges to seem real. This is all about lowering your guard.Step 3: The hook \u2014 Creating urgency or fearNow they trigger your emotions with urgent, scary or tempting messages:\u201cYour wallet is at risk \u2014 act now!\u201d\u201cExclusive airdrop ending in 5 minutes!\u201d\u201cWe detected suspicious activity \u2014 please verify your account!\u201dThey use fear, excitement and time pressure to force you into quick action without thinking.Step 4: The ask \u2014 Extracting sensitive infoThis is where the real trap springs. They ask you to:Share your private key or seed phrase (a big red flag)Click a link to a phishing site that looks like MetaMask, Phantom or OpenSeaApprove a suspicious smart contract that drains your walletSend a small amount of crypto to \u201cverify your account\u201d or \u201cunlock\u201d funds.If you fall for this step \u2014 game over.Step 5: The heist \u2014 Draining your cryptoOnce they get your sensitive info or get you to sign a malicious transaction, they:Instantly drain your wallet of coins and tokensSwap your assets into privacy coins (e.g., Monero) to hide the trailLaunder the funds through mixers or exchanges.Victims usually realize the theft too late; sadly, funds are gone forever in most cases.Did you know? Onchain analyst ZachXBT uncovered an additional $45 million stolen from Coinbase users in early May 2025 through social engineering scams \u2014 a tactic he says is uniquely prevalent on the platform compared to other crypto exchanges.                  Common types of social engineering scams in crypto              Scammers target crypto users via phishing, impersonation, giveaway and romance scams, and fake investment platforms.PhishingPhishing remains one of the most prevalent forms of social engineering in the crypto world. This can take several forms but typically involves fake websites, apps or emails designed to look legitimate.Fake wallet apps: Scammers create fake versions of popular wallet apps like MetaMask or Trust Wallet. They trick users into downloading these apps, which then steal the private keys and funds stored within them.Fake exchanges: Similarly, attackers might impersonate well-known cryptocurrency exchanges. Victims are sent a link to a phishing site that looks identical to a legitimate platform, such as Binance or Coinbase. Once users log in and input their details, the attacker gains access to their funds.Fake MetaMask pop-ups: One common trick involves fake pop-ups that prompt MetaMask users to enter their seed phrase or private keys, thereby giving scammers control over their wallets.ImpersonationImpersonation scams occur when attackers pose as legitimate figures \u2014 whether that\u2019s support staff, crypto influencers or even friends \u2014 to convince victims to hand over their information or funds.Fake support staff: In many cases, scammers will impersonate customer support agents for popular crypto wallets or exchanges. They might reach out to users claiming there\u2019s an issue with their account and ask for sensitive information, such as a password or seed phrase.Influencers and friends: Attackers might pretend to be well-known crypto influencers or friends, asking for funds or convincing victims to participate in a scam. In some cases, attackers even go as far as to hijack a social media account of a crypto personality, offering fake giveaways or investment opportunities.Giveaway scams\u201cSend 1 ETH, get 2 ETH back\u201d \u2014 this is the classic giveaway scam that has made its rounds throughout the crypto community. Scammers pose as trusted entities, often mimicking celebrities like Elon Musk or official crypto exchanges, claiming they\u2019re running a giveaway.The catch? The scammer asks you to send cryptocurrency to a specified wallet address in exchange for a larger amount of crypto that you\u2019ll receive \u201clater.\u201d Once the funds are sent, they disappear.Romance and friendship scamsRomance and friendship scams, often known as pig butchering, occur when an attacker builds an emotional connection with the victim through messaging platforms like Telegram or even dating apps. Over time, the scammer gains the victim\u2019s trust and then lures them into a fake investment opportunity, often involving cryptocurrency.Victims are manipulated into sending funds to what they believe is a secure investment, only to lose all their money when the scammer disappears.Fake investment platformsFake investment platforms promise extremely high returns with minimal risk \u2014 too good to be true. These scams might mimic legitimate crypto investment platforms, promising high returns on crypto investments or passive income streams.\u00a0Once users deposit their funds, the platform either disappears or the scammer stops responding to communication.                  Why social engineering works so well in crypto              Social engineering attacks thrive in the cryptocurrency world because they take advantage of certain vulnerabilities that are unique to the space. The combination of psychological manipulation, technical complexity and the irreversible nature of crypto transactions makes crypto users particularly susceptible to these types of scams.\u00a0Below are the key factors that explain why social engineering is so effective in the crypto environment:Fear and urgency: Crypto scams often create a sense of urgency to pressure victims into acting quickly. Common examples include emails or messages stating, \u201cYour account is locked!\u201d or \u201cYou need to verify your identity to avoid losing access to your funds!\u201d These messages push users to make impulsive decisions that they later regret.Greed: Social engineering tactics often prey on a person\u2019s desire to make quick, easy money. Scammers might promise users huge returns on investment or offer \u201cexclusive\u201d crypto deals that seem too good to pass up. This appeals to the greed of crypto investors, making them more likely to act impulsively.Lack of crypto security knowledge: Many crypto users, especially beginners, may not fully understand how crypto security works. This makes them more susceptible to attacks like phishing, where they might unknowingly give up their private keys or passwords. Scammers take advantage of this lack of knowledge to manipulate and deceive.                  How to protect yourself from social engineering attacks              While social engineering is hard to prevent entirely, staying vigilant, using 2FA, verifying links and practicing strong security habits can significantly reduce your risk.Several steps you can take to minimize your risk include:Be skeptical of unsolicited messages: Always be cautious when you receive unsolicited messages, whether by email, SMS or social media. If someone contacts you out of the blue asking for sensitive information or money, verify the authenticity of the message before acting.Enable two-factor authentication (2FA): Always use 2FA whenever possible. This adds an extra layer of security to your accounts, making it harder for attackers to gain access \u2014 even if they manage to obtain your password.Verify links and URLs: Before clicking on any link, hover your cursor over it to see where it leads. If the URL looks suspicious or doesn\u2019t match the official site, don\u2019t click it. Always double-check URLs for legitimacy, especially when dealing with crypto transactions.Educate yourself and others: The best defense against social engineering is knowledge. Stay informed about common scams and share this knowledge with others. The more you know, the less likely you are to fall for a scam.Use strong security practices: Consider using hardware wallets for storing your crypto assets, as these are considered much safer than keeping them on exchange platforms or software wallets. Always keep your private keys and seed phrases secure and never share them with anyone.In a crypto world full of scammers, your best defense is vigilance, education and strong security practices \u2014 because even the smartest tech can\u2019t protect you from a well-crafted con.",

    "title":"Can you stake Bitcoin (BTC)? Here\u2019s what you need to know",
    "description":"Key takeawaysThough Bitcoin doesn\u2019t support native staking, holders can earn yield through centralized lending platforms, Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) on Ethereum, and Bitcoin-related networks like Babylon and Stacks.WBTC allows BTC holders to participate in lending, liquidity pools and yield farming on Ethereum-based DeFi platforms like Aave and Curve but introduces bridge and smart contract risks.Protocols like Babylon and Stacks use mechanisms like native time-locked scripts or stacking to offer rewards without removing BTC from the Bitcoin blockchain.Custodial, smart contract and regulatory risks persist. Bitcoin\u2019s community also remains divided on whether Bitcoin yield generation features align with its decentralized and trust-minimized ethos.Unlike proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchains like Ethereum or Cardano, Bitcoin relies on proof-of-work (PoW) mining for network security. However, with the rise of decentralized finance (DeFi) and layer-2 innovations, Bitcoin (BTC) holders can now generate passive income through various yield-generating methods. These include centralized lending, Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) on Ethereum, and layer-2 solutions like Babylon and Stacks.This article explores how to earn yield on BTC, the risks involved and the technological advancements enabling these opportunities, all without altering Bitcoin\u2019s core protocol.Staking vs. miningStaking and mining are two distinct consensus mechanisms used to secure blockchain networks and validate transactions.\u00a0Staking is central to PoS blockchains like Ethereum and Solana. Participants lock up cryptocurrency to become validators, who are randomly selected to create new blocks and confirm transactions, earning rewards. The more coins staked, the higher the chance of selection.Mining, used by PoW blockchains like Bitcoin and Litecoin, involves miners solving complex mathematical puzzles with powerful computers. The first to solve the puzzle adds a new block and receives a reward. Mining demands significant energy and hardware.Bitcoin\u2019s PoW design means it does not support staking. The network relies entirely on miners to ensure decentralization and security. There are no validators or staking rewards in the traditional sense. Yield-generating methods for BTC, such as lending or layer-2 solutions, are not equivalent to PoS staking.Did you know? Some staking platforms offer liquid staking, where you get a token representing your staked asset (like stETH for Ether). This lets you earn staking rewards and still use your capital in DeFi protocols.Ways to earn yield on BitcoinWhile you cannot natively stake BTC due to its PoW mechanism, there are alternative methods to help you earn yield on your BTC holdings and make passive income. These methods often involve using third-party platforms or bridging BTC to other blockchains.Centralized lending platformsCentralized lending platforms like Binance Earn, Nexo and Ledn enable you to earn with BTC deposited, which the platform lends to institutional borrowers. In return, you receive interest, which might be paid daily or monthly. But this method involves custodial risk, as users must trust the platform to remain solvent and secure. The collapse of firms like Celsius and BlockFi has highlighted this vulnerability.\u00a0WBTC on EthereumWBTC is an ERC-20 token backed 1:1 by BTC, held by a centralized custodian (BitGo). It enables BTC holders to engage in Ethereum-based DeFi protocols, such as lending on Aave, providing liquidity on Curve or yield farming. This unlocks DeFi\u2019s potential but introduces risks from BitGo\u2019s custody, bridge vulnerabilities and smart contract bugs.Bitcoin layer-2 platformsEmerging layer-2 platforms such as Babylon and Stacks also enable you to explore Bitcoin-native yield opportunities. Babylon locks BTC in time-locked scripts to secure its PoS network, while Stacks uses a proof-of-transfer (PoX) model where STX tokenholders lock tokens to earn BTC rewards. These platforms expand Bitcoin\u2019s utility without leaving its ecosystem entirely.Did you know? Ethereum became the largest PoS network in 2022 after \u201cthe Merge,\u201d replacing miners with validators. This move reportedly reduced the blockchain\u2019s energy consumption by over 99.95%, making it one of the greenest major crypto networks.How to earn yield with BTC on a centralized lending platformEarning yield on BTC via centralized platforms is straightforward. Choose a reputable platform, create a verified account, deposit BTC, select a flexible or fixed-term lending option, confirm terms, and monitor earnings. Funds can typically be withdrawn after the term.Using Binance Earn as an example, the platform offers multiple yield options:Simple Earn: Beginner-friendly, offering stable yields through flexible or locked savings products.Dual Investment: Higher-risk, with returns based on the settlement price of two assets, exposing users to market volatility.On-chain Yield: Bridges funds to DeFi protocols like Aave, with variable yields managed by Binance.Yields and terms vary by option and market conditions. Simple Earn offers lower, predictable returns with flexible withdrawals, while Dual Investment and On-chain Yield may yield higher but riskier returns with locked terms. Check Binance Earn for current rates.After subscribing:Simple Earn: BTC is locked (fixed term) or withdrawable (flexible term), with interest paid daily or at term\u2019s end.Dual Investment: Funds are committed to a target price and settlement date, with yields paid in the deposited or alternative asset.On-chain Yield: Funds are deployed to DeFi protocols, with Binance handling gas fees and smart contracts. Withdrawals may face delays due to liquidity or network issues.Rewards depend on the platform, BTC amount and program terms.How to earn yield with WBTC on EthereumWBTC allows BTC holders to earn yield on Ethereum\u2019s DeFi platforms, such as Aave or Curve, by depositing WBTC into liquidity pools and earning interest or fees.Steps to earn yield with WBTC, using Curve as an example:Convert BTC to WBTC: Use a centralized exchange (CEX) (e.g., Binance) or decentralized bridge (e.g., RenBridge) to convert BTC to WBTC, custodied by BitGo.Transfer WBTC to a wallet: Move WBTC to a Web3 wallet like MetaMask and make sure you have enough Ether (ETH) for gas fees.Connect to a DeFi protocol: Visit Curve.fi and deposit WBTC into a liquidity pool via the platform\u2019s interface.Earn yield: By providing liquidity, you earn interest or fees based on pool performance.How to earn yield using Bitcoin layer 2sLayer-2 solutions like Babylon and Stacks enable yield generation by leveraging Bitcoin\u2019s security. Babylon, for example, locks BTC as collateral to secure its PoS network, connecting to Cosmos zones (interconnected blockchains). Babylon\u2019s Genesis mainnet launched on April 10, 2025, with over 57,000 BTC staked, valued at approximately $4.6 billion.Steps to earn yield with Babylon:Set up a compatible wallet: Use a wallet like OKX or Phantom, supporting Native SegWit (bc1q) or Taproot (bc1p) addresses. Avoid wallets with Bitcoin Inscriptions (Ordinals).Access the Babylon stake app: Visit the Babylon Stake app, which is active post-Genesis launch.Connect your wallet: Link your BTC wallet and approve digital signature requests for platform interaction.Choose a finality provider: Select from over 250 finality providers (e.g., Galaxy, Figment) that secure Babylon\u2019s network.Set transaction fees: Choose default or custom fees (higher fees ensure faster confirmation) and enter the BTC amount to lock.Confirm and monitor: Lock BTC via the app and track status in the Babylon Staking Terminal. Rewards include BABY tokens, split 50-50 between BTC and BABY stakers.Did you know? In some countries, crypto yield rewards are taxed as income upon receipt and as capital gains when sold. Tax treatment varies, so consult a professional.Innovative mechanisms in Bitcoin layer-2 protocolsLayer-2 protocols enhance Bitcoin\u2019s scalability and functionality. Babylon and Stacks introduce unique mechanisms to generate yield while leveraging Bitcoin\u2019s security.Native time-locked scripts in Babylon ProtocolBabylon locks BTC in self-custodial, time-locked scripts on the Bitcoin blockchain, using it as collateral to secure its PoS network, launched on April 10, 2025. This non-custodial model supports Cosmos zones without requiring bridges or wrapping. BTC stakers delegate to Finality Providers, earning BABY tokens, while BABY stakers support block production. This trustless system enables delegated voting and restaking across PoS chains.Stacking in the Stacks ProtocolStacking is Stacks\u2019 yield mechanism, using proof-of-transfer (PoX). STX tokenholders lock Stacks (STX) for ~2 weeks to support network consensus, earning BTC rewards paid by Stacks miners. This non-custodial process, available via platforms like Okcoin or Xverse, creates an economic link to Bitcoin without locking BTC itself.Coinbase Bitcoin Yield Fund (CBYF) ExplainedCoinbase Asset Management has launched the Coinbase Bitcoin Yield Fund (CBYF) on May 1, aiming to deliver sustainable Bitcoin-denominated returns for institutional investors outside the US.\u00a0The fund uses a conservative cash-and-carry arbitrage strategy, capitalizing on price gaps between spot and futures markets, while steering clear of high-risk tactics like leveraged loans or call selling.\u00a0Targeting annual net returns of 4\u20138% in BTC, CBYF offers a safer alternative for earning yield on Bitcoin \u2014 an asset that lacks native staking options unlike other cryptocurrencies.Risks involved in earning yield with BTCGenerating yield on BTC involves risks distinct from PoS staking due to reliance on third-party services or layer 2s:Custodial risk: Centralized platforms (e.g., Binance, Nexo) and WBTC\u2019s custodian (BitGo) hold BTC, risking losses if they face insolvency, hacks or regulatory shutdowns.Smart contract risk: WBTC bridges and DeFi platforms like Aave are vulnerable to bugs or exploits.Liquidity risk: Locked BTC in fixed-term programs or low-liquidity pools may be inaccessible during market shifts.Network maturity: Newer protocols like Babylon may face technical or adoption challenges.Market risk: Price volatility can offset yield during bear markets.Regulatory risk: Centralized platforms and custodians face Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) scrutiny, and yield may be taxed as income or capital gains, depending on jurisdiction.\u00a0How earning yield with BTC may evolveBitcoin\u2019s yield landscape is evolving through layer-2 and DeFi innovations. Babylon and Stacks pioneer trustless solutions, locking BTC or STX without centralized custodians. Future advancements may include more non-custodial, Bitcoin-native systems using cryptographic tools to unlock value while preserving Bitcoin\u2019s censorship resistance.\u00a0However, purists argue that yield generation risks diluting Bitcoin\u2019s role as hard money, sparking debates over balancing utility and security.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations. Every investment and trading move involves risk, and readers should conduct their own research when making a decision.",

This non-custodial process, available via platforms like Okcoin or Xverse, creates an economic link to Bitcoin without locking BTC itself.Coinbase Bitcoin Yield Fund (CBYF) ExplainedCoinbase Asset Management has launched the Coinbase Bitcoin Yield Fund (CBYF) on May 1, aiming to deliver sustainable Bitcoin-denominated returns for institutional investors outside the US.\u00a0The fund uses a conservative cash-and-carry arbitrage strategy, capitalizing on price gaps between spot and futures markets, while steering clear of high-risk tactics like leveraged loans or call selling.\u00a0Targeting annual net returns of 4\u20138% in BTC, CBYF offers a safer alternative for earning yield on Bitcoin \u2014 an asset that lacks native staking options unlike other cryptocurrencies.Risks involved in earning yield with BTCGenerating yield on BTC involves risks distinct from PoS staking due to reliance on third-party services or layer 2s:Custodial risk: Centralized platforms (e.g., Binance, Nexo) and WBTC\u2019s custodian (BitGo) hold BTC, risking losses if they face insolvency, hacks or regulatory shutdowns.Smart contract risk: WBTC bridges and DeFi platforms like Aave are vulnerable to bugs or exploits.Liquidity risk: Locked BTC in fixed-term programs or low-liquidity pools may be inaccessible during market shifts.Network maturity: Newer protocols like Babylon may face technical or adoption challenges.Market risk: Price volatility can offset yield during bear markets.Regulatory risk: Centralized platforms and custodians face Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) scrutiny, and yield may be taxed as income or capital gains, depending on jurisdiction.\u00a0How earning yield with BTC may evolveBitcoin\u2019s yield landscape is evolving through layer-2 and DeFi innovations. Babylon and Stacks pioneer trustless solutions, locking BTC or STX without centralized custodians. Future advancements may include more non-custodial, Bitcoin-native systems using cryptographic tools to unlock value while preserving Bitcoin\u2019s censorship resistance.\u00a0However, purists argue that yield generation risks diluting Bitcoin\u2019s role as hard money, sparking debates over balancing utility and security.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

    "description":"Key points:Bitcoin holds on to its recent gains, increasing the possibility of a retest of the all-time high at $109,588.BlackRock\u2019s spot Bitcoin ETF records 19 days of successive inflows, showing solid demand.\u00a0Select altcoins are showing strength, having broken out of their large basing patterns.Bitcoin (BTC) made a decisive move above the psychologically crucial $100,000 level during the week, signaling that the bulls are back in the game. Buyers are trying to hold on to the 10% weekly gains over the weekend.Bitcoin\u2019s rally has been backed by solid inflows into the BlackRock spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (IBIT). According to Farside Investors\u2019 data, the fund stretched its inflows streak to 19 days, with the latest trading week attracting $1.03 billion in inflows.Crypto market data daily view. Source: Coin360The rally was not limited to Bitcoin alone, as several altcoins also moved higher. That has prompted analysts to announce the start of an altseason, with some predicting sharp rallies in altcoins over the next few months. However, not everyone believes that an altseason has started because the altcoins have only made modest moves compared to the massive price erosion from their respective all-time highs.\u00a0\u00a0Could Bitcoin break out to a new all-time high and maintain it? If it does, let\u2019s study the charts of the cryptocurrencies that may move higher in the near term.Bitcoin price predictionBitcoin has been gradually inching toward the all-time high of $109,588, indicating that the bulls are in no hurry to book profits.BTC\/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph\/TradingViewThe rally has pushed the relative strength index (RSI) into the overbought zone, suggesting a correction or consolidation in the near term. Any pullback is expected to find support between $100,000 and the 20-day exponential moving average ($96,626). If the price rebounds off the support zone, it increases the possibility of a break above $109,588. If that happens, the BTC\/USDT pair could surge toward $130,000.Time is running out for the bears. If they want to make a comeback, they will have to swiftly yank the price below the 20-day EMA. If they succeed, the pair could plunge to the 50-day simple moving average ($88,962).BTC\/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: Cointelegraph\/TradingViewThe pair continues to climb higher, but the bears are expected to fiercely defend the $107,000 to $109,588 zone. If the price turns down from the overhead zone, the 20-EMA is likely to act as strong support. A bounce off the 20-EMA signals that the bullish momentum remains intact. That enhances the prospects of a breakout above $109,588.Sellers will have to tug the price below $100,000 to weaken the positive momentum. That opens the doors for a fall to $93,000 and subsequently to $83,000.Ether price predictionEther (ETH) skyrocketed from $1,808 on May 8 to $2,600 on May 10, indicating aggressive buying by the bulls.ETH\/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph\/TradingViewThe up move pushed the RSI into the overbought territory, indicating a minor pullback or consolidation is possible in the near term. The first support on the downside is $2,320 and then $2,111. If the price turns up from the support levels, the ETH\/USDT pair could extend the rally to $2,850 and later to $3,000.The optimistic view will be invalidated in the near term if the price breaks below $2,111. That could result in a range formation between $1,754 and $2,600.ETH\/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: Cointelegraph\/TradingViewThe bulls pushed the price above the $2,550 resistance but could not sustain the higher levels. A minor positive in favor of the bulls is that they have not ceded much ground to the bears. That suggests the bulls are holding on to their positions as they anticipate the up move to continue. If the price turns up from the current level of the 20-EMA and breaks above $2,609, the rally could reach $3,000.\u00a0A deeper correction could begin if the price continues lower and plummets below the 20-EMA. That could sink the pair toward the solid support at $2,111.Dogecoin price predictionDogecoin (DOGE) soared above the $0.21 overhead resistance on May 10, indicating a change in the short-term trend.DOGE\/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph\/TradingViewThe rally is facing selling at $0.26, which could result in a retest of the breakout level of $0.21. If the price rebounds off $0.21 with strength, it suggests a change in sentiment from selling on rallies to buying on dips. That increases the likelihood of a rally to $0.31.\u00a0If buyers want to prevent the upside, they will have to pull the price below the 20-day EMA ($0.19). If they do that, the DOGE\/USDT pair could swing inside a large range between $0.26 and $0.14 for a while.\u00a0DOGE\/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: Cointelegraph\/TradingViewThe pair has turned down from $0.26, with immediate support at $0.22 and then at $0.21. If the price rebounds off the support zone, it suggests a positive sentiment where dips are being purchased. The bulls will then again try to resume the uptrend by pushing the price above $0.26.Conversely, a drop below $0.21 signals that the bulls are rushing to the exit. That could pull the price to the 50-day SMA.Related: Ethereum to $10K 'can't be ruled out' as ETH price makes sharp gains vs. SOL, XRPPepe price predictionPepe (PEPE) rallied sharply from the 50-day SMA ($0.000008) and broke above the $0.000011 overhead resistance on May 8.PEPE\/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph\/TradingViewThe rally has pushed the RSI into the overbought zone, signaling a pullback may be around the corner. The PEPE\/USDT pair could drop to the breakout level of $0.000011. If the price rebounds off $0.000011, it suggests that the bulls have flipped the level into support. That improves the prospects for a rally to $0.000017 and then to $0.000020.This optimistic view will be negated in the near term if the price turns down and breaks below the 20-day EMA ($0.000009).PEPE\/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: Cointelegraph\/TradingViewThe 4-hour chart shows that the bears are aggressively defending the $0.000014 level. That could pull the price down to the 20-EMA, which is a vital level to keep an eye on. If the price rebounds off the 20-EMA, the bulls will make another attempt to shove the pair above $0.000014. If they can pull it off, the pair could ascend to $0.000017.On the contrary, a break and close below the 20-EMA could sink the pair to $0.000011. Buyers are expected to defend the $0.000011 level with all their might because a slide below it may extend the pullback to the 50-SMA.Cosmos price predictionCosmos (ATOM) broke out of the large base when it closed above $5.15 on May 10. That signals a potential trend change.ATOM\/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph\/TradingViewHowever, the bears are unlikely to give up easily. They will try to pull the price back below the $5.15 level. If they manage to do that, the aggressive bulls may get trapped, pulling the price to the moving averages.\u00a0Alternatively, if buyers sustain the price above $5.15, the ATOM\/USDT pair could pick up momentum and rally to $6.50. Sellers will try to halt the up move at $6.50, but if the bulls prevail, the pair could rally to $7.50.ATOM\/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: Cointelegraph\/TradingViewThe sharp rally has pushed the RSI into the overbought zone on the 4-hour chart, suggesting a short-term correction or consolidation. The bulls will have to defend the critical $5.15 level if they want to keep the positive momentum intact. If they manage to do that, the pair could rally to $6.60.Contrarily, a break and close below $5.15 could pull the price down to the 20-EMA. This is an important level to watch out for because a break below it may sink the pair to $4.70.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

Buyers are trying to hold on to the 10% weekly gains over the weekend.Bitcoin\u2019s rally has been backed by solid inflows into the BlackRock spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (IBIT). According to Farside Investors\u2019 data, the fund stretched its inflows streak to 19 days, with the latest trading week attracting $1.03 billion in inflows.Crypto market data daily view. Source: Coin360The rally was not limited to Bitcoin alone, as several altcoins also moved higher. That has prompted analysts to announce the start of an altseason, with some predicting sharp rallies in altcoins over the next few months. However, not everyone believes that an altseason has started because the altcoins have only made modest moves compared to the massive price erosion from their respective all-time highs.\u00a0\u00a0Could Bitcoin break out to a new all-time high and maintain it? If it does, let\u2019s study the charts of the cryptocurrencies that may move higher in the near term.Bitcoin price predictionBitcoin has been gradually inching toward the all-time high of $109,588, indicating that the bulls are in no hurry to book profits.BTC\/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph\/TradingViewThe rally has pushed the relative strength index (RSI) into the overbought zone, suggesting a correction or consolidation in the near term. Any pullback is expected to find support between $100,000 and the 20-day exponential moving average ($96,626). If the price rebounds off the support zone, it increases the possibility of a break above $109,588. If that happens, the BTC\/USDT pair could surge toward $130,000.Time is running out for the bears. If they want to make a comeback, they will have to swiftly yank the price below the 20-day EMA. If they succeed, the pair could plunge to the 50-day simple moving average ($88,962).BTC\/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: Cointelegraph\/TradingViewThe pair continues to climb higher, but the bears are expected to fiercely defend the $107,000 to $109,588 zone. If the price turns down from the overhead zone, the 20-EMA is likely to act as strong support. A bounce off the 20-EMA signals that the bullish momentum remains intact. That enhances the prospects of a breakout above $109,588.Sellers will have to tug the price below $100,000 to weaken the positive momentum. That opens the doors for a fall to $93,000 and subsequently to $83,000.Ether price predictionEther (ETH) skyrocketed from $1,808 on May 8 to $2,600 on May 10, indicating aggressive buying by the bulls.ETH\/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph\/TradingViewThe up move pushed the RSI into the overbought territory, indicating a minor pullback or consolidation is possible in the near term. The first support on the downside is $2,320 and then $2,111. If the price turns up from the support levels, the ETH\/USDT pair could extend the rally to $2,850 and later to $3,000.The optimistic view will be invalidated in the near term if the price breaks below $2,111. That could result in a range formation between $1,754 and $2,600.ETH\/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: Cointelegraph\/TradingViewThe bulls pushed the price above the $2,550 resistance but could not sustain the higher levels. A minor positive in favor of the bulls is that they have not ceded much ground to the bears. That suggests the bulls are holding on to their positions as they anticipate the up move to continue. If the price turns up from the current level of the 20-EMA and breaks above $2,609, the rally could reach $3,000.\u00a0A deeper correction could begin if the price continues lower and plummets below the 20-EMA. That could sink the pair toward the solid support at $2,111.Dogecoin price predictionDogecoin (DOGE) soared above the $0.21 overhead resistance on May 10, indicating a change in the short-term trend.DOGE\/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph\/TradingViewThe rally is facing selling at $0.26, which could result in a retest of the breakout level of $0.21. If the price rebounds off $0.21 with strength, it suggests a change in sentiment from selling on rallies to buying on dips. That increases the likelihood of a rally to $0.31.\u00a0If buyers want to prevent the upside, they will have to pull the price below the 20-day EMA ($0.19). If they do that, the DOGE\/USDT pair could swing inside a large range between $0.26 and $0.14 for a while.\u00a0DOGE\/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: Cointelegraph\/TradingViewThe pair has turned down from $0.26, with immediate support at $0.22 and then at $0.21. If the price rebounds off the support zone, it suggests a positive sentiment where dips are being purchased. The bulls will then again try to resume the uptrend by pushing the price above $0.26.Conversely, a drop below $0.21 signals that the bulls are rushing to the exit. That could pull the price to the 50-day SMA.Related: Ethereum to $10K 'can't be ruled out' as ETH price makes sharp gains vs. SOL, XRPPepe price predictionPepe (PEPE) rallied sharply from the 50-day SMA ($0.000008) and broke above the $0.000011 overhead resistance on May 8.PEPE\/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph\/TradingViewThe rally has pushed the RSI into the overbought zone, signaling a pullback may be around the corner. The PEPE\/USDT pair could drop to the breakout level of $0.000011. If the price rebounds off $0.000011, it suggests that the bulls have flipped the level into support. That improves the prospects for a rally to $0.000017 and then to $0.000020.This optimistic view will be negated in the near term if the price turns down and breaks below the 20-day EMA ($0.000009).PEPE\/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: Cointelegraph\/TradingViewThe 4-hour chart shows that the bears are aggressively defending the $0.000014 level. That could pull the price down to the 20-EMA, which is a vital level to keep an eye on. If the price rebounds off the 20-EMA, the bulls will make another attempt to shove the pair above $0.000014. If they can pull it off, the pair could ascend to $0.000017.On the contrary, a break and close below the 20-EMA could sink the pair to $0.000011. Buyers are expected to defend the $0.000011 level with all their might because a slide below it may extend the pullback to the 50-SMA.Cosmos price predictionCosmos (ATOM) broke out of the large base when it closed above $5.15 on May 10. That signals a potential trend change.ATOM\/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph\/TradingViewHowever, the bears are unlikely to give up easily. They will try to pull the price back below the $5.15 level. If they manage to do that, the aggressive bulls may get trapped, pulling the price to the moving averages.\u00a0Alternatively, if buyers sustain the price above $5.15, the ATOM\/USDT pair could pick up momentum and rally to $6.50. Sellers will try to halt the up move at $6.50, but if the bulls prevail, the pair could rally to $7.50.ATOM\/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: Cointelegraph\/TradingViewThe sharp rally has pushed the RSI into the overbought zone on the 4-hour chart, suggesting a short-term correction or consolidation. The bulls will have to defend the critical $5.15 level if they want to keep the positive momentum intact. If they manage to do that, the pair could rally to $6.60.Contrarily, a break and close below $5.15 could pull the price down to the 20-EMA. This is an important level to watch out for because a break below it may sink the pair to $4.70.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

The Ethereum Improvement Proposal introduces the SetCode transaction (type 0x04), which enables users to delegate control of their wallet to another contract simply by signing a message.If an attacker obtains this signature \u2014 say, via a phishing site \u2014 they can overwrite the wallet\u2019s code with a small proxy that forwards calls to their malicious contract.\u201cOnce the code is set,\u201d Usman explained, \u201cthe attacker can invoke that code to transfer out the account\u2019s ETH or tokens\u2014all without the user ever signing a normal transfer transaction.\u201dSource: Vladimir S. | Officer's NotesRelated: Ethereum Pectra upgrade adds new featuresWallets can be altered with offchain signatureYehor Rudytsia, onchain researcher at Hacken, noted that this new transaction type introduced by Pectra allows arbitrary code to be installed on the user\u2019s account, essentially turning their wallet into a programmable smart contract.\u201cThis tx type allows the user to set arbitrary code (smart contract) to be able to execute operations on the user\u2019s behalf,\u201d Rudytsia said.Before Pectra, wallets could not be modified without a transaction signed directly by the user. Now, a simple offchain signature can install code that delegates complete control to an attacker\u2019s contract.\u201cPre-Pectra, users needed to send transaction (not sign message) to allow their funds to be moved\u2026 Post-Pectra, any operation may be executed from the contract which user approved via SET_CODE,\u201d Rudytsia explained.The threat is real and immediate. \u201cPectra activated May 7, 2025. From that moment, any valid delegation signature is actionable,\u201d Usman warned. He added that smart contracts relying on outdated assumptions, such as using tx.origin or basic EOA-only checks, are particularly vulnerable.Wallets and interfaces that fail to detect or properly represent these new transaction types are most at risk. Rudytsia warned that \u201cwallets are vulnerable if they do not analyze Ethereum\u2019s transaction types,\u201d especially transaction type 0x04.He emphasized that wallet engines must clearly display delegation requests and flag any suspicious addresses.This new form of attack can be easily executed through common offchain interactions like phishing emails, fake DApps, or Discord scams.\u201cWe believe it will be the most popular attack vector regarding these breaking changes introduced by Pectra,\u201d Rudytsia said. \u201cFrom now on, users have to carefully validate what they are going to sign.\u201dSource: NoirRelated: Pectra features already in use: Ethereum EIP-7702 wallets roll outHardware wallets are not safer anymoreHardware wallets are no longer inherently safer, Rudytsia said.

    "title":"8 major crypto firms announce US expansion this year",
    "description":"Crypto services platform Nexo shared its plans to reenter the United States market on Monday, marking the eighth major crypto firm to announce such plans since US President Donald Trump took office at the start of the year.Firms like Circle, Binance and OKX are banking on favorable regulatory clarity in 2025 to herald their US expansion. Bills like the STABLE Act and the GENIUS Act are advancing in Congress, which, if implemented, will lay the groundwork for swift success.Trump and his family are actively involved in some of these planned expansions. Nexo\u2019s recent announcement was backed by Donald Trump Jr., who said, \u201cWe see the opportunity for the financial sector and want to ensure we bring that back to the US.\u201dAmid concerns of conflicts of interest and blatant token shilling by the Trump family, it remains to be seen whether these upcoming regulations will adequately protect everyday investors. Regardless, these are the eight firms that have banked on big bucks in the US this year.Binance.US resumes USD services; CZ seeks clemency\u00a0Binance.US officially reinstated USD deposit and withdrawal services less than a month into Trump\u2019s presidency.\u00a0They were halted on June 13, 2023, on the back of a civil enforcement action by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), claiming willful evasion of US laws and operating illegally in the country. Binance later settled for $2.7 billion; then-CEO Changpeng Zhao paid $150 million.Soon after halting USD on- and off-ramps, the Securities and Exchange Commission sued Binance and its then-CEO, Changpeng Zhao, with a lawsuit. The agency claimed Zhao and Binance \u201cengaged in an extensive web of deception, conflicts of interest, lack of disclosure, and calculated evasion of the law.\u201dIn November 2023, Binance and CZ agreed on a settlement with the Department of Justice that included pleading guilty to federal charges, including violating Anti-Money Laundering laws, a $4.3-billion fine, CZ\u2019s dismissal as CEO and a prison sentence.Zhao has sought clemency from President Trump, who has pardoned a number of crypto executives.\u00a0Zhao (right) discusses his clemency request. Source: Farokh RadioeToro files for US IPO after 2024 enforcement actionOnline trading platform eToro publicly filed its registration statement for a proposed initial public offering (IPO) on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the ticker symbol \u201cETOR.\u201d The IPO is anticipated to occur as early as Q2 2025, pending market conditions, with eToro seeking a $4-billion valuation with plans to raise $500 million by offering 10 million Class A shares.\u00a0The trading platform ran into some trouble with the SEC in 2024, when the agency claimed eToro \u201coperated an unregistered broker and unregistered clearing agency in connection with its trading platform that facilitated buying and selling certain crypto assets as securities.\u201dAs a result, eToro paid a fine and agreed to reduce its crypto offerings for US customers to Bitcoin (BTC), Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and Ether (ETH).The move signals growing investor confidence in the future of retail cryptocurrency trading platforms in the US as the jurisdiction reorients its rules defining cryptocurrencies and loosens restrictions that made it more difficult for such platforms to receive banking services.\u00a0OKX relaunches in the US months after $500-million settlementOKX, a major global cryptocurrency exchange, announced its reentry into the US market in April 2025. The company is implementing a phased rollout plan throughout the year and has established a new regional headquarters in San Jose, California. The firm also named Roshan Robert, recently of Barclays, as head of its US operations.\u00a0Edit the caption here or remove the textThe relaunch comes just months after the firm announced a settlement with the US Department of Justice (DOJ). US attorneys alleged that the platform \u201cknowingly violated anti-money laundering laws and avoided implementing required policies to prevent criminals from abusing our financial system\u201d for over seven years. OKX paid a hefty $500-million fine, pleaded guilty to operating an unlicensed money-transmitting business, and agreed to pay for an external compliance consultant. In a statement, OKX said, \u201cThere were no allegations of customer harm, no charges against any Company employee and no government appointed monitor as part of the settlement.Related: OKX to restart DEX with anti-abuse upgrades after Lazarus \u2018misuse\u2019Robert told Fortune that the firm was ramping up its compliance and risk management infrastructures ahead of the relaunch. He also cited the improving regulatory landscape as a contributor to the relaunch. \u201cThe rulemaking will take some time, but there is a path that we can see,\u201d he said.Nexo returns to US markets after deadlock with regulatorsNexo, a global digital assets wealth platform, announced its return to the US market on April 28, 2025, at an event in Sofia, Bulgaria. According to industry media, US customers will have access to Nexo\u2019s asset-backed credit lines, crypto savings accounts and advanced trading options.Nexo left the US in 2022 after 18 months of negotiations with federal regulators reached an impasse. Eight different state regulators had charged Nexo with allegedly failing to register its Earn Interest Product.Nexo co-founder Antoni Trenchev credited the crypto-friendly approach of President Trump with his firm\u2019s relaunch: \u201cAmerica is back \u2014 and so is Nexo.\u201d\u201cNexo is returning to America \u2014 stronger, smarter, and determined to win,\u201d he added.Circle relocates to NYC ahead of IPOCircle, the issuer of the USDC (USDC) stablecoin, is relocating its global headquarters from Boston to New York City in early 2025. The move to One World Trade Center aligns with Circle\u2019s plans for an initial public offering and reflects its commitment to integrating with traditional financial markets.\u00a0Circle filed for its IPO on April 1 and plans to list on the New York Stock Exchange. JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup are serving as lead underwriters. The firm is seeking a $5-billion valuation.\u00a0Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire said, \u201cOur new headquarters near the top of One World Trade Center is a symbol of the trust, security and stability we\u2019re building as a critical infrastructure provider for the future of finance.\u201dCircle initially sought to go public via a blank-check firm in 2022, but the deal fell through. The deal would have valued Circle at $9 billion at the time.\u00a0Crypto.com introduces stock and ETF tradingCrypto.com is expanding its services in the US throughout 2025, including introducing trading for stocks and ETFs.\u00a0The company is rolling out these offerings in phases as part of its 2025 roadmap, including significant expansions of its banking, crypto, stock and credit card services for US customers.\u00a0The plan shows the company\u2019s broader strategy of integrating crypto with traditional finance, a theme recurring with many crypto and finance firms operating in the US. Travis McGhee, Crypto.com managing director and head of global capital markets, said that the firm is letting clients \u201cmarry up that capability [trading stocks and ETFs] with your crypto trading, as well as your crypto derivative trading.\u201d\u00a0McGhee added that \u201cthere\u2019s a lot of tailwinds\u201d pushing the industry ahead, including an \u201cadministration that is [...] looking to put a regulatory framework into place.\u201d\u00a0\u201cThat just bodes well for a strong market and a strong future for crypto.\u201da16z returns to US after initial UK moveAndreessen Horowitz (a16z) announced that it is closing shop in the UK and focusing its efforts on the US.\u00a0In a Jan. 24 X post, Anthony Albanese, chief operating officer of Andreessen Horowitz\u2019s crypto arm, said the firm will be closing its UK branch despite the \u201centhusiasm for crypto building and adoption\u201d in the country.According to Sifted, the UK government had spent five years wooing a16z to move to London, just for the firm to leave 18 months after it opened its offices there. Related: A16z leads $25M funding for Miden blockchain projectA16z launched offices in London in 2023, citing the regulatory environment under former President Joe Biden as too unfriendly to the blockchain industry. Albanese said there was \u201cstrong momentum\u201d behind the crypto industry with the inauguration of President Trump.Per TechCrunch, other factors driving a16z\u2019s relocation were the slow progress on crypto in the UK and the Labour government shifting its priorities away from digital assets.Coinbase acquires Deribit in bid to capture derivatives marketUS-based crypto exchange Coinbase bought crypto derivatives platform Deribit for $2.9 billion on May 8.\u00a0The merger makes Coinbase the largest crypto derivatives platform by open interest, per an exchange blog post.\u00a0The deal comes as major crypto exchanges like Coinbase, Kraken and Robinhood jockey to dominate the growing global crypto derivative market.

The company is implementing a phased rollout plan throughout the year and has established a new regional headquarters in San Jose, California. The firm also named Roshan Robert, recently of Barclays, as head of its US operations.\u00a0Edit the caption here or remove the textThe relaunch comes just months after the firm announced a settlement with the US Department of Justice (DOJ). US attorneys alleged that the platform \u201cknowingly violated anti-money laundering laws and avoided implementing required policies to prevent criminals from abusing our financial system\u201d for over seven years. OKX paid a hefty $500-million fine, pleaded guilty to operating an unlicensed money-transmitting business, and agreed to pay for an external compliance consultant. In a statement, OKX said, \u201cThere were no allegations of customer harm, no charges against any Company employee and no government appointed monitor as part of the settlement.Related: OKX to restart DEX with anti-abuse upgrades after Lazarus \u2018misuse\u2019Robert told Fortune that the firm was ramping up its compliance and risk management infrastructures ahead of the relaunch. He also cited the improving regulatory landscape as a contributor to the relaunch. \u201cThe rulemaking will take some time, but there is a path that we can see,\u201d he said.Nexo returns to US markets after deadlock with regulatorsNexo, a global digital assets wealth platform, announced its return to the US market on April 28, 2025, at an event in Sofia, Bulgaria. According to industry media, US customers will have access to Nexo\u2019s asset-backed credit lines, crypto savings accounts and advanced trading options.Nexo left the US in 2022 after 18 months of negotiations with federal regulators reached an impasse. Eight different state regulators had charged Nexo with allegedly failing to register its Earn Interest Product.Nexo co-founder Antoni Trenchev credited the crypto-friendly approach of President Trump with his firm\u2019s relaunch: \u201cAmerica is back \u2014 and so is Nexo.\u201d\u201cNexo is returning to America \u2014 stronger, smarter, and determined to win,\u201d he added.Circle relocates to NYC ahead of IPOCircle, the issuer of the USDC (USDC) stablecoin, is relocating its global headquarters from Boston to New York City in early 2025. The move to One World Trade Center aligns with Circle\u2019s plans for an initial public offering and reflects its commitment to integrating with traditional financial markets.\u00a0Circle filed for its IPO on April 1 and plans to list on the New York Stock Exchange. JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup are serving as lead underwriters. The firm is seeking a $5-billion valuation.\u00a0Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire said, \u201cOur new headquarters near the top of One World Trade Center is a symbol of the trust, security and stability we\u2019re building as a critical infrastructure provider for the future of finance.\u201dCircle initially sought to go public via a blank-check firm in 2022, but the deal fell through. The deal would have valued Circle at $9 billion at the time.\u00a0Crypto.com introduces stock and ETF tradingCrypto.com is expanding its services in the US throughout 2025, including introducing trading for stocks and ETFs.\u00a0The company is rolling out these offerings in phases as part of its 2025 roadmap, including significant expansions of its banking, crypto, stock and credit card services for US customers.\u00a0The plan shows the company\u2019s broader strategy of integrating crypto with traditional finance, a theme recurring with many crypto and finance firms operating in the US. Travis McGhee, Crypto.com managing director and head of global capital markets, said that the firm is letting clients \u201cmarry up that capability [trading stocks and ETFs] with your crypto trading, as well as your crypto derivative trading.\u201d\u00a0McGhee added that \u201cthere\u2019s a lot of tailwinds\u201d pushing the industry ahead, including an \u201cadministration that is [...] looking to put a regulatory framework into place.\u201d\u00a0\u201cThat just bodes well for a strong market and a strong future for crypto.\u201da16z returns to US after initial UK moveAndreessen Horowitz (a16z) announced that it is closing shop in the UK and focusing its efforts on the US.\u00a0In a Jan. 24 X post, Anthony Albanese, chief operating officer of Andreessen Horowitz\u2019s crypto arm, said the firm will be closing its UK branch despite the \u201centhusiasm for crypto building and adoption\u201d in the country.According to Sifted, the UK government had spent five years wooing a16z to move to London, just for the firm to leave 18 months after it opened its offices there. Related: A16z leads $25M funding for Miden blockchain projectA16z launched offices in London in 2023, citing the regulatory environment under former President Joe Biden as too unfriendly to the blockchain industry. Albanese said there was \u201cstrong momentum\u201d behind the crypto industry with the inauguration of President Trump.Per TechCrunch, other factors driving a16z\u2019s relocation were the slow progress on crypto in the UK and the Labour government shifting its priorities away from digital assets.Coinbase acquires Deribit in bid to capture derivatives marketUS-based crypto exchange Coinbase bought crypto derivatives platform Deribit for $2.9 billion on May 8.\u00a0The merger makes Coinbase the largest crypto derivatives platform by open interest, per an exchange blog post.\u00a0The deal comes as major crypto exchanges like Coinbase, Kraken and Robinhood jockey to dominate the growing global crypto derivative market.

    "description":"Opinion by: Kevin Rusher, founder of RAACIt\u2019s a volatile world out there. This year, we\u2019ve seen stocks take a wild ride as gold has pumped and crypto has been caught somewhere in the middle. Investors have dumped risk assets and scrambled for safe havens. Gold is leading the charge.While gold is safe, it is not very hard-working. Unlike cash and treasuries, the yellow metal does not generate income. Now, more than ever, investors need to be able to earn yield on gold \u2014 particularly in the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector. The only way to make money from gold is to buy low and sell high. Most investors don\u2019t tend to buy gold like this. That\u2019s for good reason \u2014 over the long term, gold\u2019s performance is typically consistent, if not without a few peaks and troughs here and there, as we have recently seen. For example, after the 2008 financial crisis, the price of gold soared 148% but stagnated for nearly a decade before the COVID-19 pandemic triggered another rally, and it's likely we will see gold hold, if not fall from it's new record high once markets revive. While it remains an excellent hedge, gold\u2019s long-term track record is not a growth story.Investors prefer US Treasurys or high-yield savings accounts as part of a balanced portfolio. While gold may outperform these assets in uncertain times, it offers a better balance of security and predictable income over the long term.\u00a0The DeFi solution\u00a0This is where DeFi brings innovation to the world\u2019s oldest asset. DeFi can significantly modernize gold investing, offering the speed and transparency of blockchain-based transactions and the ability to earn returns.Currently, though, most tokenized gold is much the same as holding it in an exchange-traded fund (ETF). Stablecoin giants like Tether and Paxos have launched gold-backed tokens, which they say are fully backed by physical, audited gold reserves, yet offer no yield.Recent: Bitcoin\u2019s safe-haven appeal grows during trade war uncertaintyMost DeFi investors prefer liquid, tradable assets like cryptocurrencies and stablecoins, which can generate attractive returns. Many would rather, for example, buy Tether\u2019s USDt (USDT) stablecoin and stake it, earning rewards while still maintaining ownership.Perhaps this is why the market capitalization of gold-backed tokens remains modest. Tether Gold, the world\u2019s most significant gold token, has a market capitalization of just under $835 million, for example, while Paxos Gold sits at around $799 million. Combined, this is equivalent to just 1% of the market cap of USDT.\u00a0Unlocking income from the world\u2019s oldest asset\u00a0To unlock gold\u2019s full potential, we need to take tokenization a step further by creating a DeFi ecosystem where tokenized gold is actively put to work \u2014 borrowed, lent and integrated into yield-bearing strategies.One possibility is for companies such as gold miners is to issue tokenized versions of their reserves that can be turned into stablecoins that can then be staked to earn a yield. Leveraging protocols whose liquidity mechanisms enable the trading of stablecoins and real-world asset (RWA) tokens, holders could take advantage of further yield opportunities throughout the DeFi ecosystem.Beyond the benefits of yield opportunities, blockchain technology means investors in tokenized gold can benefit from the flexibility of 24-hour trading, near real-time price discovery and near-instant settlement without compromising the stability of the asset.\u00a0The future of gold investingIt is, perhaps, ironic that \u2014 just as governments worldwide are starting to put their stamp of approval on digital finance \u2014 gold is becoming a highly desirable commodity again. The public\u2019s interest in it will grow as governments essentially ratify digital finance. At the same time, the appetite for gold in these uncertain times will also increase.\u00a0DeFi could bring these trends together and kickstart a natural evolution in gold ownership that provides a solid bridge between traditional and digital finance. While gold inside traditional markets attracts investors looking for stability, DeFi brings opportunities that don\u2019t compromise that stability, as it presents new and unique yield opportunities.\u00a0Gold has captivated humanity for thousands of years. It\u2019s the foundation of myths, the standard of wealth and the ultimate hedge against uncertainty. But in today\u2019s financial world, it needs an upgrade.Through integrating gold into the DeFi ecosystem, we could unlock its true potential \u2014 not just as a store of value but as an income-generating asset.

Leveraging protocols whose liquidity mechanisms enable the trading of stablecoins and real-world asset (RWA) tokens, holders could take advantage of further yield opportunities throughout the DeFi ecosystem.Beyond the benefits of yield opportunities, blockchain technology means investors in tokenized gold can benefit from the flexibility of 24-hour trading, near real-time price discovery and near-instant settlement without compromising the stability of the asset.\u00a0The future of gold investingIt is, perhaps, ironic that \u2014 just as governments worldwide are starting to put their stamp of approval on digital finance \u2014 gold is becoming a highly desirable commodity again. The public\u2019s interest in it will grow as governments essentially ratify digital finance. At the same time, the appetite for gold in these uncertain times will also increase.\u00a0DeFi could bring these trends together and kickstart a natural evolution in gold ownership that provides a solid bridge between traditional and digital finance. While gold inside traditional markets attracts investors looking for stability, DeFi brings opportunities that don\u2019t compromise that stability, as it presents new and unique yield opportunities.\u00a0Gold has captivated humanity for thousands of years. It\u2019s the foundation of myths, the standard of wealth and the ultimate hedge against uncertainty. But in today\u2019s financial world, it needs an upgrade.Through integrating gold into the DeFi ecosystem, we could unlock its true potential \u2014 not just as a store of value but as an income-generating asset. The world\u2019s oldest safe haven asset is finally on the brink of a digital evolution.Opinion by: Kevin Rusher, founder of RAAC.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

    "description":"After 4chan was hacked on April 14 and vast troves of user and moderator data were leaked online, the controversial website quickly went down, and many believed it would never recover. However, less than two weeks later, the imageboard was back online, defiant as ever.\u201c4chan is back,\u201d an official blog post proclaimed. \u201cNo other website can replace it, or this community. No matter how hard it is, we are not giving up.\u201dThe imageboard has left its mark on the world in many consequential ways, birthing countless memes and conspiracy theories, serving as a platform for political movements ranging from the alt-right to Anonymous, and acting as a dumping ground for leaks and hacks of all sorts.\u00a0Crypto is no exception, with 4chan also a historically influential gathering place to share altcoin alpha, coordinate campaigns to pump tokens, share price prophesies and more.With the imageboard back from the dead, here are just a few of the ways it has influenced the crypto space during its storied history.Finding alpha on 4chan\u2019s \/Biz\/ imageboardThe primary hub of crypto activity on 4chan is its \/Biz\/, or \u201cBusiness & Finance,\u201d imageboard, where traders, gamblers, investors and commentators gather to share info, shill tokens, and discuss the state of the crypto industry at large.\u00a0The imageboard has gathered a reputation for being a place where intrepid investors can go to learn about moonshot tokens the broader community has yet to discover, though X and Telegram have since given 4chan a run for its money. It has also been ground zero for countless shilling campaigns that have helped pump prices for various tokens.A Reddit user shares some tokens they discovered early on, thanks to \/Biz\/. Source: Deleted Reddit account\/Biz\/ has also become known for the various prophecies, lore and legends that emerge from its anonymous users. People who claim to have inside knowledge on major market movements often leak alleged secret info on the imageboard or issue prophecies, and every once in a while, they actually turn out to be accurate.In January 2019, a user correctly predicted that Bitcoin (BTC) would hit $5,300 by April and $9,200 by July, sparking huge interest online. Unfortunately, their remaining price predictions quickly fell short of reality, including that Bitcoin would hit $87,000 by October 2020.Another user claimed in May 2021 to work at a Chinese firm that collaborated closely with the government and said they had insider information that Bitcoin would sell off due to major news out of China. A few hours later, reports emerged that China would ban payment companies and financial institutions from offering services related to crypto transactions, and Bitcoin sold off.\/Biz\/ was also the source of a June 2017 rumor that Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin had died in a car crash.

Many of the oracle project\u2019s most diehard community members, known as the LINK Marines, first discovered Chainlink on \/Biz\/.Much of the excitement among the early Chainlink community was galvanized by a mysterious figure known as \u201cAssBlaster,\u201d who claimed to have insider knowledge about the project and would share alpha on \/Biz\/.\u00a0Source: WarosuThe LINK Marines relentlessly promoted Chainlink on 4chan and social media platforms, and by 2020, LINK had experienced its first major rally \u2014 from $1.80 at the start of the year to a high of $16.64 on Aug. 12.Following the rally, Mechanism Capital co-founder Andrew Kang declared that \u201c4chan has become the largest market driver\u201d in crypto, \u201cmore powerful than even China or institutional crypto fund capital.\u201dRelated: Mechanism Capital founder doubles Bitcoin position with a $200M longLINK went on in 2021 to hit an all-time high of $49.54, becoming one of the year\u2019s most talked-about crypto success stories.LINK\u2019s price exploded to nearly $50 in 2021.

Pepe was created by artist Matt Furie back in 2005 for a comic titled Boy\u2019s Club.Over the next several years, Pepe was popularized by 4chan and eventually became a mainstream meme. But in 2015, posters from 4chan\u2019s \/R9k\/ board decided to \u201creclaim\u201d Pepe and began a campaign to intentionally associate it with the far right. Nevertheless, the frog remains a popular meme on 4chan and in crypto circles.In the cryptosphere, Pepe became closely associated with Chainlink. Sanctum CEO Tyler Ward, who sparked a Pepe non-fungible token (NFT) craze in 2021, told Magazine, \u201cWhen Chainlink started doing well, it just became this cultish prophecy of 4chan, and 4chan really likes Pepe the frog, so it was kind of this merger.\u201d\u201cA lot of people that posted about Chainlink would post with Pepe the Frog, and they kind of became intertwined.\u201dCrypto\u2019s obsession with Pepe the Frog has since grown significantly beyond its early association with Chainlink. In 2023, the memecoin Pepe (PEPE), named after the frog, was launched and quickly became popular among traders.
